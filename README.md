<img src="/media/Super_Strong.png" width="500" height="500" />

Super Strong is a program manager for strength athletes interested in progressing their strength. This app was programmed with SwiftUI, Core Data, as well as RKCalendar

## Build Instructions
This app utilizes the following libraries:
* RKCalendar

Ensure that RKCalendar is added as a package dependency for Super Strong.
This should be set by default and build without intervention, but if it does not show, follow instructions [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) with url https://github.com/workingDog/RKCalendar

## How to Use ##
Super Strong comes preloaded with a standard catalogue of lifts, some quick workouts, as well as two preset programs, 5/3/1 and Disbrow's Bench Program. To use as a program manager, navigate to the Profile tab and select one of the preloaded programs as active, or create your own program with the Create tab, then add it via the Profile tab.

Once you have an active program set, use the Workout tab to perform the next workout in your program. Mark your sets as completed as you go through, and tap to finish your workout when completed.
